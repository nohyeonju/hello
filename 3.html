    <p><strong><u>The Story</u></strong></p>
    <p>The Trump administration is getting ready to give farmers $12 billion in aid. </p>

    <strong><u>Why so generous?</u></strong>
    <p>For the past few months, the US gov has been upping tariffs on other countries (think: China, the EU, Mexico, Canada) it says aren't trading fair. Countries are hitting back. And US farmers have been hit especially hard - as countries have targeted tariffs on things like meat and soy. Now the Trump admin has an idea.</p>
    <strong><u>Which is...?</u></strong>
    <p>Make it rain. Yesterday, the Trump admin said it's going to pay US farmers to make up for the lost money. Here's how: either by cash, or by buying up what hasn't sold and sending it to food banks, or by teaming up with businesses to create new markets.</p>

    <strong><uWhat are people saying?</u></strong>
    <p>Trump says "Tariffs are the greatest!" and should be used toward countries that have taken advantage of the US for years. Lawmakers say that farmers don't want a bailout - they want an end to the trade war.</p>

    <strong><utheSkimm</u></strong>
    <p>The farming industry has been hurtin' for certain for years now. And Trump's trade war isn't helping. This new plan is being pitched as a short-term fix. But it has many worried that it's a sign the trade war isn't going away anytime soon.</p>

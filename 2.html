        <p><strong><u>The Story</u></strong><br>
        China is in the middle of a vaccine scandal.</p>

      <p><strong><u>Tell me more, tell me more.</strong></u><br>
        Kids are required by the law to get vaccinations in China. Last week, it came out that a major drug producer distributed hundreds of thousands of faulty vaccines for things like rabies as well as diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus.</p>

      <p><strong><u>Not good.</strong></u><br>
        Nope. The co's been accused of faking data and has been ordered to recall vaccines. The country's food and drug admin is investigating. And some of the co's top execs are being questioned by police.</p>

      <p><strong><u>How are people taking the news?</strong></u><br>
        They're freaking the eff out. Parents are taking to social media to voice their outrage. And China's no. 2 promised to crack down on the people involved.</p>

      <p><strong><u>theSkimm</strong></u><br>
        China's trying to become a BFD in the pharma biz. But this is not the only vaccine scandal the country's had in the past few years. This one is threatening people's trust in the gov and China's drug industry. And parents are holding tight for what it might mean for their kids.</p>

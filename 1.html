      <p><strong><u>The Story</u></strong>
        Over the weekend, Israel helped evacuate hundreds of rescue workers out of Syria.</p>

      <p><strong><u>Tell me more.</u></strong>
        They're called the White Helmets - a group of Syrians who have documented some of the atrocities of the years-long Syrian civil war. And volunteer to try and save people on the ground after airstrikes. Russia and Syria consider the group a terrorist organization, and have claimed it's linked to al-Qaeda. But it was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. And have gotten support and money from the US and Western allies...who've asked Israel to help get them out of the country.</p>

      <p><strong><u>Keep going.</u></strong>
        Syria's Assad regime is closing in on some of the last rebel-held areas in the south - where White Helmets and their families have been stranded near the border with Israel. Israel has mostly stayed out of the conflict. But the US and friends asked it for an assist with getting some of these rescue workers out. Now, hundreds of these evacuees are in Jordan for the next few months before they're resettled to Canada, Britain, and Germany.</p>

      <p><strong><u>theSkimm</u></strong>
        This was a major international effort to get rescue workers out of Syria. There are reportedly more than 3,000 White Helmets still there.</p>
